# Risk & Compliance Agent

A modular, AI-powered agent system designed to streamline risk management and regulatory compliance for financial institutions. The solution integrates machine learning for real-time fraud detection with natural language processing (NLP) for compliance analysis. It is built using Flask, Python, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services.

## Overview

The **Risk & Compliance Agent** is a multi-agent system that:
- **Monitors transactions in real time** to detect anomalous behavior and potential fraud.
- **Interprets regulatory updates** and provides compliance recommendations using an LLM.
- **Routes queries intelligently** by using a dedicated orchestrator that delegates requests to specialized agents.
- **Integrates with BigQuery** to analyze large-scale financial data.
- **Deploys on GCP** using App Engine (or Cloud Run) for scalability and reliability.

## Features

- **Modular Architecture:** Each agent (compliance, fraud, and orchestrator) is defined in its own module.
- **Intelligent Orchestration:** Uses a dedicated LLM with a custom system prompt to route queries based on intent.
- **Real-Time Analysis:** Supports streaming or batch transaction data analysis.
- **GCP Integration:** Leverages Cloud Logging, BigQuery, and Container Registry/Artifact Registry for deployment.
- **Easy Deployment:** Dockerized application with configuration for App Engine.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk) (for deployment)
- A GCP project with billing enabled
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (if building container images locally)
- Git (for version control)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/risk-compliance-agent.git
   cd risk-compliance-agent/backend
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Local Development

1. **Set Environment Variables (Optional):**

   You can create a `.env` file or set environment variables directly for `DEBUG`, `PORT`, etc.

2. **Run the Flask Application:**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Test Endpoints:**

   - Health Check: Open [http://localhost:8080/health](http://localhost:8080/health)
   - Transaction Prediction: POST to [http://localhost:8080/api/predict_transaction](http://localhost:8080/api/predict_transaction)
   - Query Endpoint: POST to [http://localhost:8080/api/query](http://localhost:8080/api/query)

## BigQuery Integration

The application can connect to BigQuery using the official Python library. For example:

```python
from google.cloud import bigquery

# Initialize BigQuery client
client = bigquery.Client()

# Execute a query
query = "SELECT name, age FROM `my-project.my_dataset.my_table` LIMIT 10"
query_job = client.query(query)

# Process results
for row in query_job:
    print(f"Name: {row['name']}, Age: {row['age']}")
```

Make sure your GCP credentials are correctly set up (e.g., using `gcloud auth application-default login`).

## Deployment to Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

### Step 1: Prepare Your GCP Environment

1. **Create a GCP Project:**
   - Go to the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a new project (e.g., `risk-compliance-agent`).

2. **Enable Required APIs:**
   - Enable App Engine, Cloud Build, Cloud Logging, and BigQuery APIs in the GCP Console.

3. **Set Up Authentication:**
   - Install the Google Cloud SDK.
   - Authenticate with:
     ```bash
     gcloud auth login
     gcloud config set project risk-compliance-agent
     ```

### Step 2: Configure App Engine

1. **Initialize App Engine:**
   ```bash
   gcloud app create --project=risk-compliance-agent
   ```

2. **Deploy the Application:**
   - From the `backend` directory, run:
     ```bash
     gcloud app deploy
     ```
   - Confirm and wait for the deployment to complete.

3. **Verify Deployment:**
   - Access your application at:
     ```
     https://<your-project-id>.appspot.com/health
     ```
   - You should see a JSON response: `{ "status": "ok" }`.

### Step 3: Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

- **Connect Your Repository:**
  - Use Cloud Source Repositories or connect GitHub/Bitbucket to GCP for automated deployments.
- **Cloud Code for VS Code:**
  - Install [Cloud Code](https://cloud.google.com/code) for a seamless development and deployment experience directly from VS Code.
